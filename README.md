The goal of this project was to create an algorithm to automate the tedious task of scheduling employees, while optimizing for preferred shifts and fairness among the staff. I used Excel and Python to accomplish this, and the result is a probabilistic, iterative model that accounts for many factors such as seniority, attendance, and time off requests.

To use this project yourself, download the ScheduleInputData file and adjust the data to your preferences.
Make sure the file link is inputted correctly in the 5 lines of main.py.
Adjust the manager parameters, and then run main.py to export your schedule.
